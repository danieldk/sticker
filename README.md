**sticker** is a sequence labeler using neural networks.

## Introduction

sticker is a sequence labeler that uses either recurrent neural
networks or dilated convolution networks. In principle, it can be
used to perform any sequence labeling task, but so far the focus
has been on:

* Part-of-speech tagging
* Topological field tagging
* Dependency parsing
